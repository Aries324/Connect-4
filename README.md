In Connect Four, one player is assigned Red and the other player is assigned Black. Players alternate inserting their pieces into one of the 7 columns of a 7x6 grid. The first player to get four of their pieces in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), wins.

In the physical world, the grid is placed perpendicular to the playing table, such that the pieces fall to the bottom and stack upon each other. The digital version of the game should yield the same end result.

The game can end in a tie, meaning all cells are filled but no player achieved four-in-a-row.

This was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the expectation that during each game, the players will be sitting at the same mouse & keyboard, alternating turns.
